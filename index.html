    <p>Hi, I am</p>
    <h1>Maryam Noor</h1>
    <h1>I build clean and modern websites for the web.</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Front-End Developer based in Pakistan. With a strong foundation in
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I create responsive and user-friendly
      websites that meet the needs of modern businesses. I have built several
      self-made projects to sharpen my skills and gain hands-on experience.
      Passionate about front-end development, I stay curious, keep learning, and
      explore new tools and techniques to improve my craft. My goal is to bring
      ideas to life through elegant, functional, and high-quality web solutions.
